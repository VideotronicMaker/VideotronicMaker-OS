# VTM OS™ Platform

The **VTM OS™** is an open-core platform designed to bridge the gap between high-level cognitive processing and real-time physical control. This repository hosts the **Community Edition**, providing a foundational framework for makers and developers to implement bio-mimetic AI on microcontrollers like the **Arduino Uno Q**.

## 🧠 System Architecture: VTM Bio-Mimetic™

The architecture mimics a biological nervous system by decoupling high-level reasoning from real-time execution.

### 1. The Host Platform ("The Mind")
* **VTM Personality Core™ (Community):** Basic local host management and LLM API bridging.
* **Function:** Handles cognition and "Thought Processing" to determine intent.

### 2. The BioLink Interface ("The Body")
* **VTM-BioLink Protocol™ (Community):** The open telemetry standard for translating AI intent into fluid, organic motion.
* **Target Hardware:** Optimized for the high-speed execution of the **Arduino Uno Q**.

## 🛠 Open-Core Licensing Model

VTM OS™ operates on an **Open-Core** model to support the maker community while maintaining professional-grade standards for industrial applications.

* **Community Edition (This Repo):** Licensed under **MIT**. This includes the core communication protocols and basic architecture for non-commercial use and community experimentation.
* **Professional/Industrial:** Advanced personality modules, secured telemetry, and proprietary hardware integrations are available under a **Proprietary License**.
