# VTM OS™ Platform

**Status:** Proprietary Development / Closed Beta
**Architect:** VTM Systems

---

## ⚠️ Commercial Pivot Notice

The **VTM OS™ Platform** (formerly VideotronicMaker) has transitioned from an open research initiative into a proprietary commercial architecture. This repository now serves as the public documentation hub for the closed-source platform.

**Note:** Legacy open-source experiments have been archived to support this transition.

## 🧠 System Architecture: VTM Bio-Mimetic™

The VTM OS™ is built on a proprietary **Bio-Mimetic Architecture** that decouples high-level reasoning from real-time physical control, mimicking a biological nervous system.

### 1. The Host Platform ("The Mind")
* **Core:** VTM Personality Core™
* **Function:** A secured local host managing complex reasoning, LLM API bridging (BYOK Architecture), and system telemetry. Handles high-level cognition and "Thought Processing."

### 2. The BioLink Interface ("The Body")
* **Protocol:** VTM-BioLink Protocol™
* **Function:** A high-speed telemetry standard replacing legacy serial communication. It translates AI intent into organic, fluid motion rather than robotic actuation.

## 🔒 Access & Licensing

The source code for VTM OS™ is **Closed Source / Proprietary**.

* **Public Release:** To Be Announced (TBA)
* **Development Updates:** Follow the [Official LinkedIn](YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL) for development logs and "Founder's Edition" availability.
