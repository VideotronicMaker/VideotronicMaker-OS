# VTM OS™ Platform

**Status:** Proprietary Development / Closed Beta
**Producer:** VideotronicMaker

---

## ⚠️ Commercial Release Notice

The **VTM OS™ Platform** is a new proprietary commercial architecture produced by **VideotronicMaker**. This repository serves as the public documentation hub for the closed-source platform.

**Note:** Technical documentation for this specific commercial release is hosted here. Educational tutorials and open-source community projects continue separately.

## 🧠 System Architecture: VTM Bio-Mimetic™

The VTM OS™ is built on a proprietary **Bio-Mimetic Architecture** that decouples high-level reasoning from real-time physical control, mimicking a biological nervous system.

### 📚 Architecture Documentation
* **[Flagship: Arduino Uno Q Architecture](docs/Arduino_Uno_Q/architecture.md)** (Integrated Model)

### 1. The Host Platform ("The Mind")
* **Core:** VTM Personality Core™
* **Function:** A secured local host managing complex reasoning, LLM API bridging (BYOK Architecture), and system telemetry. Handles high-level cognition and "Thought Processing."

### 2. The BioLink Interface ("The Body")
* **Protocol:** VTM-BioLink Protocol™
* **Function:** A high-speed telemetry standard replacing legacy serial communication. It translates AI intent into organic, fluid motion rather than robotic actuation.

---

## 🔒 Access & Licensing

The source code for VTM OS™ is **Closed Source / Proprietary**.

* **Public Release:** To Be Announced (TBA)
* **Development Updates:** Follow the [Official LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/videotronicmaker) for development logs and "Founder's Edition" availability.
