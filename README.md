# VTM OS™ Platform

**Status:** Proprietary Development / Community Edition Roadmap
**Producer:** VideotronicMaker

---

## 🚀 The Mission
The **VTM OS™ Platform** bridges the gap between maker projects and high-performance embedded AI. By targeting the **Arduino Uno Q**, we are bringing professional-grade architecture to the most accessible hardware in the community.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture: VTM Bio-Mimetic™

The VTM OS™ is built on a **Bio-Mimetic Architecture** that decouples high-level reasoning from real-time physical control, mimicking a biological nervous system.

### 📚 Platform Documentation
* **[Flagship: Arduino Uno Q Architecture](docs/Arduino_Uno_Q/architecture.md)** (Integrated Model)

### 1. The Host Platform ("The Mind")
* **Core:** VTM Personality Core™
* **Function:** A secured local host managing complex reasoning, LLM API bridging (BYOK Architecture), and system telemetry.

### 2. The BioLink Interface ("The Body")
* **Protocol:** VTM-BioLink Protocol™
* **Function:** Translates AI intent into organic, fluid motion, optimized for the high-speed processing capabilities of the **Uno Q**.

---

## 🔒 Access & Roadmap

The VTM OS™ utilizes an **Open-Core** model to support the global maker community:

* **Community Edition:** Open-source foundation in development. Follow this repo for the first public commit.
* **Commercial Platform:** Proprietary plugins and industrial integrations.
* **Development Updates:** Follow the [Official LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/videotronicmaker-com/) for development logs and "Founder's Edition" availability.
