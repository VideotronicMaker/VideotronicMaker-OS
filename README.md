## 🚀 Commercial Release Status: Jan 10, 2025

The **VTM OS™ Platform** (formerly VideotronicMaker) has evolved from an open research initiative into a proprietary commercial architecture. We are currently finalizing the **Release Candidate (RC1)** for the official launch.

This repository now serves as the public landing page for the commercial platform.

## 🧠 System Architecture: VTM Bio-Mimetic™

The VTM OS™ is built on a proprietary **Bio-Mimetic Architecture** that decouples high-level reasoning from real-time physical control, mimicking a biological nervous system.

### 1. The Host Platform (The Mind)
* **VTM Personality Core™:** A proprietary, secured local host that manages complex reasoning, LLM API bridging (BYOK Architecture), and system telemetry.
* **Function:** Handles higher-level cognition and "Thought Processing."

### 2. The BioLink Interface (The Body)
* **VTM-BioLink Protocol™:** A proprietary, high-speed telemetry standard that replaces legacy serial communication.
* **Bio-Mimetic Kinetics:** Translates AI intent into organic, fluid motion rather than robotic actuation.
* **Function:** Handles "Reflex Actions" and real-time motor control.

---

### 🔒 Access & Licensing

The source code for VTM OS™ is now **Closed Source / Proprietary**.

* **Commercial Inquiries:** Please contact VTM Systems.
* **Legacy Support:** Previous open-source experiments have been archived.
* **Founder's Edition:** Early access will be granted to select partners on **Jan 10, 2025**.
